This program utilizes Jupyter Lab to visualize performance history metrics from four large hedge funds and the S&P 500. The metrics being visualized in this program are: Daily Performance, Risk, Volitlity, Sharpe Ratio and Beta Measurements. 

At the end of the analysis the two funds with the highest risk-to-return profiles are compared against each other. Once compared, a recommendation is made for which fund a firm should invest in.

## Analysis
