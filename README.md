This program utilizes Jupyter Lab to visualize performance history metrics from four large hedge funds and the S&P 500. The metrics being visualized in this program are: Daily Performance, Risk, Volitlity, Sharpe Ratio and Beta Measurements. 

At the end of the analysis we take the two funds with the highest risk-to-return profiles and compare them against each other and the S&P 500. Once determined, a recommendation is made for which fund is the better investment.
